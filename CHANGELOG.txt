v0.3.1 — Faster UX + controls
- Per-site checkboxes before building (choose exactly which domains to crawl)
- Big, visible 'BUILD / REFRESH INDEX' button (always on the page)
- Speed controls: max pages per site, concurrency (threads), and path filters
- Reuses cached pages unless 'Force re-crawl' is checked (much faster)

v0.3.0 — Ultra‑light build
- Removed scikit‑learn, numpy, pandas to eliminate heavy wheels
- Implemented pure‑Python TF‑IDF + cosine similarity
